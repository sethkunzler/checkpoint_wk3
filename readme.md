<!-- TODO I need to figure out why keep getting errors about form elelment tags being incorrectly labeled when I press the 'delete' button on my active note element. it probably has something to do with the windows pop up sweet alert messages.-->
<!-- TODO I also Need to add the Save button feature.  before that it would probably be easier to add the auto update, and the update on mouse leave like the model does, and just have the Save button update the timestamp on the screen.  -->
<!-- TODO I need to make the X button clear the active note. -->
<!-- TODO I need to be able to type words to the text box and have them save to the body property of the note object. -->
<!-- TODO I need to make sure that it saves to local data -->
<!-- TODO Check to make sure I have completed all of the requirements for this checkpoint -->s
<!-- TODO check to make sure I have finished all of the TODO's through out the application -->
